Traditionally, High Performance Computing (HPC) workloads have been running on dedicated bare-metal clusters ranging from tens to thousands of nodes. Recently, cloud computing, both private and public, has attracted more HPC users due to its key benefits, such as ease of management, on-demand resource provisioning, etc. A significant challenge for running HPC in the cloud, however, is to maintain high performance and quality-of-service while simultaneously supporting multiple tenants sharing the same infrastructure. 
In this paper, we present our work in optimizing resource allocation for HPC cloud with 
multi-tenancy and high efficiency. As a starting point, we apply virtualization to 
enforce security and fairness for isolation between tenants. Additionally, 
we explore CPU and memory over-commitment to improve resource utilization and system throughput while minimizing interference.
%we design \textit{vHERO}, as a novel approach to allocating cloud resources to HPC with multi-tenancy, efficiency, and security. 
%Built on top of virtualization, vHERO guarantees security and fairness for isolation between tenants. 
%Furthermore, CPU and memory over-commitment are explored to achieve high resource utilization and system throughput while minimizing interference. 
By benchmarking popular HPC workloads, we demonstrate that virtualization with resource over-commitment could achieve even better performance than bare-metal clusters in certain scenarios.
