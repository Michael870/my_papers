The main motivation of this work stems from the observation that, as Cloud Computing continues to grow, both the failure rate and energy consumption are highly-likely to increase significantly. Hence, understanding the interplay between fault-tolerance, energy consumption and profit maximization is critical for the viability of Cloud Computing. 

To this end, I propose Shadow Replication as a novel, scalable, and energy-aware fault tolerance framework to minimize energy and maximize profit.
%To assess the performance of the proposed fault-tolerance computational model, an extensive performance evaluation study is carried out. In this study, system properties that affect the profitability of fault tolerance methods, namely failure rate, targeted response time and static power, are identified. Our performance evaluation shows that in all cases, Shadow Replication outperforms existing fault tolerance methods.
Our preliminary results predict that Shadow Replication is able to achieve significant energy saving and profit gains while satisfying SLA requirements. I will continue to explore and optimize Shadow Replication in support of green and sustainable Cloud Computing.
