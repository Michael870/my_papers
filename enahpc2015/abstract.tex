Current fault-tolerance approaches are designed to deal with both
physical and logical fail stop errors and typically rely on the
classic checkpoint-restart technique for recovery. The proposed
solutions differ in their design, the type of faults they manage and
the fault tolerance protocol they use.  The major shortcoming of
checkpoint-restart stems from the potentially prohibitive costs, in
terms of execution time and energy consumption. Since faults are both
voluminous and diverse, the inherent instability of future large-scale
high performance computing infrastructures calls for a wholesale
reconsideration of the fault tolerance problem and the exploration of
radically different approaches that go beyond adapting or optimizing
existing checkpointing and rollback techniques. To this end, we
propose Lazy Shadowing, a novel energy-aware computational model to
support scalable fault-tolerance in future large-scale
high-performance computing infrastructure. We present two schemes
for applying lazy shadowing to high performance computing: energy
optimal shadowing and stretched shadowing. All of the proposed schemes provide the same
level of fault-tolerance as state machine replication while achieving significant energy
savings.
