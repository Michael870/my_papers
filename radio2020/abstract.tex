Traditionally, High Performance Computing (HPC) is mainly used at research institutes to solve advanced scientific and engineering problems. Nowadays, more and more enterprises start to embrace HPC to speed up innovation. In addition, the recent boom of AI/ML has greatly propelled the adoption of HPC since machine learning is widely viewed as part of HPC from a workload perspective. HPC has been adopted in a broad spectrum of fields, including drug discovery, electronic design automation, risk management and portfolio optimization, etc. This creates a tremendous opportunity for VMware as enterprises start to realize that virtualization can also bring benefits to HPC. 

Performance is the No.1 priority in HPC. Therefore, a significant challenge for virtualizing HPC is to maintain high performance while simultaneously supporting multiple users sharing the same infrastructure.
In this work, 
we design \textit{vHERO} to virtualize HPC clusters with multi-tenancy, efficiency, and security. 
Built on top of virtualization, vHERO guarantees security and fairness for multi-tenancy support. Furthermore, CPU and memory over-commitment are explored to achieve high resource utilization. 
Experimental results demonstrate that vHERO with CPU over-commitment can achieve even better system throughput than bare-metal clusters, and memory over-commitment can also be practical in certain scenarios.
