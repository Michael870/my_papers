With the rapid expansion of enterprise HPC and growth of AI/ML applications, a new opportunity is presented to VMware 
to virtualize these emerging workloads and grow its revenue. 
Our work presents a new approach to virtualizing HPC with VMware technologies, and we successfully demonstrate its feasibility through a comprehensive performance study. In the future, 
we plan to extend the scope of this work to cover more workloads, such as MPI workloads, and to build 
analytical models to predict the trade-off between performance and over-commitment degree based on 
workload characterization~\cite{arlitt1997internet,234855}.
