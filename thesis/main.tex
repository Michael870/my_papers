\begin{abstract}
Two major trends in large-scale computing systems are the rapid growth
in High Performance Computing (HPC) with in particular an international
exascale initiative, and the dramatic expansion of Cloud infrastructure accompanied by the Big Data trends.  
To satisfy the continuous demand for increasing computing capacity, future extreme-scale systems will embrace a multi-fold 
increase in the number of computing, storage, and communication components, in order to support an unprecedented level 
of parallelism. Despite the power and economies of scale, making the transition to extreme-scale poses numerous unavoidable scientific and technological challenges. 

As the demand for computing power continues to increase, both HPC community and Cloud service providers are building larger computing platforms to take advantage of the power and economies of scale. On the HPC side, %several of the most powerful countries are competing for developing the next generation supercomputer--exascale computing machines 
a race is underway to build the world's first exascale supercomputer 
to accelerate scientific discoveries, big data analytics, etc. On the Cloud side, major IT companies are all expanding large-scale datacenters, for both private usage and public services. 
However, making the transition to extreme-scale poses numerous unavoidable scientific and technological challenges.
%However, aside from the benefits, several daunting challenges will appear when it comes to extreme-scale.

This thesis aims at simultaneously solving two major challenges, i.e., power consumption and fault tolerance, for future extreme-scale computing systems. We study a novel computational model that is power-aware and fault-tolerant. Different techniques have been explored to embody this model. Accordingly, precise analytical models and optimization framework have been developed to quantify and optimize the performance, respectively. 

In this document, I summarize my progress in the development of the Lazy Shadowing concept and propose to continue the research in two aspects. Firstly, I propose to develop a MPI-based prototype to validate Lazy Shadowing in real environment. Using the prototype, I will run benchmarks and real applications to measure its performance and compare to state-of-the-art approaches. Then, I propose to further explore the adaptivity of Lazy Shadowing and improve its efficiency. Based on the specific system configuration, application characteristics, and QoS requirement, I will study 
the impact of process mapping and the viability of partial shadowing.

%We begin by saying that we do not really have much to say, but for the sake of clarity we divide our topic in chapters.

%\chapter{Second chapter}
%The topics treated in this chapter can be somewhat obscure. For humanitarian considerations, the chapter will be subdivided.

%The topic treated here, given its complexity, merits an additional subdivision.

%\subsection{Second subsection of the section}
%This is a very complicated topic and we shall discuss it in our next paper.
%\chapter{Conclusions}
%This is the second chapter of the present dissertation. It is more interesting than the first one, for it is the last one.
