% Make the title.

\maketitle 



% Place your abstract within the special {sciabstract} environment.

%\begin{sciabstract}
%  This document presents a number of hints about how to set up your
%  {\it Science\/} paper in \LaTeX\ .  We provide a template file,
%  \texttt{scifile.tex}, that you can use to set up the \LaTeX\ source
%  for your article.  An example of the style is the special
%  \texttt{\{sciabstract\}} environment used to set up the abstract you
%  see here.
%\end{sciabstract}



% In setting up this template for *Science* papers, we've used both
% the \section* command and the \paragraph* command for topical
% divisions.  Which you use will of course depend on the type of paper
% you're writing.  Review Articles tend to have displayed headings, for
% which \section* is more appropriate; Research Articles, when they have
% formal topical divisions at all, tend to signal them with bold text
% that runs into the paragraph, for which \paragraph* is the right
% choice.  Either way, use the asterisk (*) modifier, as shown, to
% suppress numbering.

\section*{Acknowledgement}


The author would like to thank Dr. Bryan Mills for developing the initial analytical model (modeling of a single task) for Shadow Computing with DVFS. For clarification, the author performed all the other work presented in this paper.

% Following is a new environment, {scilastnote}, that's defined in the
% preamble and that allows authors to add a reference at the end of the
% list that's not signaled in the text; such references are used in
% *Science* for acknowledgments of funding, help, etc.

%\begin{scilastnote}
%\item We've included in the template file \texttt{scifile.tex} a new
%environment, \texttt{\{scilastnote\}}, that generates a numbered final
%citation without a corresponding signal in the text.  This environment
%can be used to generate a final numbered reference containing
%acknowledgments, sources of funding, and the like, per {\it Science\/}
%style.
%\end{scilastnote}




% For your review copy (i.e., the file you initially send in for
% evaluation), you can use the {figure} environment and the
% \includegraphics command to stream your figures into the text, placing
% all figures at the end.  For the final, revised manuscript for
% acceptance and production, however, PostScript or other graphics
% should not be streamed into your compliled file.  Instead, set
% captions as simple paragraphs (with a \noindent tag), setting them
% off from the rest of the text with a \clearpage as shown  below, and
% submit figures as separate files according to the Art Department's
% instructions.


%\clearpage

%\noindent {\bf Fig. 1.} Please do not use figure environments to set
%up your figures in the final (post-peer-review) draft, do not include graphics in your
%source code, and do not cite figures in the text using \LaTeX\
%\verb+\ref+ commands.  Instead, simply refer to the figure numbers in
%the text per {\it Science\/} style, and include the list of captions at
%the end of the document, coded as ordinary paragraphs as shown in the
%\texttt{scifile.tex} template file.  Your actual figure files should
%be submitted separately.
