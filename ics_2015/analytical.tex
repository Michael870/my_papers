Three important metrics for assessing the quality of an application's execution, when Lazy Shadowing is used, are 1) the application failure probability, which measures the level of reliability; 2) expected completion time; and 3) expected energy consumption. In the following we develop mathematical models to be used for evaluation in the next section, with the understanding
that process replication is a special case of Lazy Shadowing where $\alpha=1$.
