The expected energy consumption for checkpointing and process replication can be calculated with Equation~\ref{eq:exp_energy1}. To calculate the expected energy consumption for Lazy Shadowing with Equation~\ref{eq:exp_energy2}, we further assume that the dynamic power during shadow leaping is twice the dynamic power during normal execution, i.e., $p_{l}=2*p_d$, and the time for shadow leaping is half the time for recovery, i.e., $E[T_l]=0.5*(E[T_c] - w)$. Figure~\ref{fig:exp_energy12} shows the comparison results with all the energy consumption values normalized to that of process replication, with Figure~\ref{fig:exp_energy1} assumes static power accounts for 50\% of system power and Figure~\ref{fig:exp_energy2} assumes 70\%. Although checkpointing is the most efficient when execution time is short, Lazy Shadowing performs the best at large scale.
