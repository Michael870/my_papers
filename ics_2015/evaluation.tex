Careful analysis of the mathematical models above leads us to identify several important factors that influence the quality of an application's execution using Lazy Shadowing. These factors can be classified into three categories, i.e., system category, application category, and Lazy Shadowing category. The system category includes static power ratio, $\rho$ ($\rho=p_s/p$), and MTBF of each core; the application category is mainly the total workload, $W$; and Lazy Shadowing category involves the number of cores to use, $N$, and main to shadow ratio, $\alpha$, which together determine the number of main cores and shadow cores ($N=M+S$ and $\alpha=M/S$). In this section, we evaluate each performance metric of Lazy Shadowing, 
 %using the models above, 
 with the influence of each of the factors considered. %First we calculate the application failure probability for various scenarios. Then we proceed to study the expected energy consumption and completion time under different application failure probabilities.
