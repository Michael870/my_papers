Three important metrics for assessing the quality of an application's execution are 1) reliability; 2) completion time; and 3) energy consumption. In the following we develop mathematical models to analyze the expected performance of Lazy Shadowing, as well as prove the bound on performance compared to non-failure case, with the understanding
that process replication is a special case of Lazy Shadowing where $\alpha=1$. 
All the analysis below is under the assumption that there are a total of $N$ cores, and $W$ is the application workload.  
$M$ of the $N$ cores are allocated for main processes, each having a workload of $w=\frac{W}{M}$, and the rest $S$ cores are for collocated shadow processes. For process replication,
$M=S=\frac{N}{2}$, and $w=\frac{2W}{N}$.
