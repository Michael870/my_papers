\begin{abstract}
As the demand for computing power continue to increase, both HPC community and Cloud service provides are building larger computing platforms to take advantage of the power and economies of scale. On the HPC side, %several of the most powerful countries are competing for developing the next generation supercomputer--exascale computing machines 
a race is underway to build the world's first exascale supercomputer 
to accelerate scientific discoveries, big data analytics, etc. On the Cloud side, major IT companies are all expanding large-scale datacenters, for both private usage and public services. However, aside from the benefits, several daunting challenges will appear when it comes to extreme-scale.

This thesis aims at simultaneously solving two major challenges, i.e., power consumption and fault tolerance, for future extreme-scale computing systems. We come up with a novel power-aware computational model, referred to as Lazy Shadowing, to achieve high-levels of resilience in extreme-scale and failure-prone computing environments. Different approaches have been studied to apply this model. Accordingly, precise analytical models and optimization framework have been developed to quantify and optimize the performance, respectively. 

In this work, I propose to continue the research in two aspects. Firstly, I propose to develop a MPI-based prototype to validate Lazy Shadowing in real environment. Using the prototype, I will run benchmarks and real applications to measure its performance and compare to state-of-the-art approaches. Then, I propose to further explore the potential of Lazy Shadowing and improve its efficiency. Based on the specific system configuration, application characteristics, and QoS requirement, I will study 
the impact of process mapping the viability of partial shadowing.
