As our reliance on IT continues to increase, the complexity and urgency of the problems our society will face in the future will increase much faster than are our abilities to understand and deal with them. Future IT systems are likely to exhibit a level of interconnected complexity that makes it prone to failure and exceptional behaviors. The high risk of relying on IT systems that are failure-prone calls for new approaches to enhance their performance and resiliency to failure. 

Nowadays, two types of systems are widely used to enable us to solving

\section{Contributions}
This thesis makes the following contributions:

\begin{itemize}
\item We perform pioneering study on DRAM restoring in deep sub-micron scaling. We built models to simulate restoring behaviors and then generate DRAM devices to faithfully repeat the manufacturing process  and perform architectural-level studies.
\item Targeting at restoring issues, we propose schemes from different perspectives. On device and architectural levels, we apply chunk remapping and chip clustering techniques to achieve fast memory access; on system level, we maximizing performance improvement by allocating hot pages of the running workloads to fast regions.
\item Going further, we integrate restoring variation characteristics with approximate computing to strike a good balance among performance, energy and accuracy. We then explore restoring issues in extended scenarios including information leakage and 3D-stacked memory.  
\end{itemize}


\section{OUTLINE}
\label{outline}
The rest of this proposal is organized as follow:  
Chapter \ref{chapter:background} introduces the DRAM structures, operations and scaling issues.
In Chapter \ref{chapter:twr_reorganize}, we build models to study restoring effects, and then propose a series of techniques to shorten restoring timing values.
In Chapter \ref{chapter:partialrestore}, we explore the correlation between restoring and refresh, and seek the opportunities to early terminate restore operations.
Further restoring explorations are discussed in Chapter \ref{chapter:future_study}.
Chapter \ref{chapter:timeline} and \ref{chapter:summary} lists the timeline and concludes the proposal, respectively.
