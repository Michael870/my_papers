Current fault tolerance approaches rely exclusively on either time or hardware redundancy to hide failures from being seen by users. 
Rollback recovery, which exploits time redundancy, requires full or partial re-execution when failure occurs.  
Such an approach
can incur a significant delay, % subjecting cloud service providers to SLA violations,
and high power costs due to extended execution time.
On the other hand, Process Replication relies on hardware redundancy and executes multiple
instances of the same task in parallel to guarantee completion with minimal delay. 
This solution, however, requires a significant increase in hardware resources and increases the power consumption proportionally.
