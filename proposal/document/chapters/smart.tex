In the most general form of Lazy Shadowing, each main is associated with one shadow that executes the same workload. This is ignorant of the variance in the underlying hardware reliability and above application criticality. Previous studies have shown that failure rates both vary across systems and vary across nodes within the same system~\cite{schroeder2007,di2014lessons}. According to \cite{di2014lessons}, 19\% of the nodes account for 92\% of the machine check errors on Blue Waters. The reason is complicated and may attribute to the manufacture process, heterogeneous architecture, environment factors (e.g. temperature, voltage supply), and/or workloads. At the same time, within a system processes may have different criticality. This is true when the execution model has a single point of failure. For example, in the master-slave execution model, the failure of the master process is more severe than the failure of a single slave process. This is also true when the user specifies different QoS. For example, in Cloud Computing, users may choose differernt level of QoS in terms of Service Level Agreement requiring different amount of payment.
