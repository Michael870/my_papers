    Abstract = {Provided certain obstacles are overcome, we believe
                  Cloud Computing has the potential to transform a
                  large part of the IT industry, making software even
                  more attractive as a service and shaping the way IT
                  hardware is designed and purchased.  Developers with
                  innovative ideas for new interactive Internet
                  services no longer require the large capital outlays
                  in hardware to deploy their service or the human
                  expense to operate it. They need not be concerned
                  about over-provisioning for a service whose
                  popularity does not meet their predictions, thus
                  wasting costly resources, or under-provisioning for
                  one that becomes wildly popular, thus missing
                  potential customers and revenue. Moreover, companies
                  with large batch-oriented tasks can get their
                  results as quickly as their programs can scale,
                  since using 1000 servers for one hour costs no more
                  than using one server for 1000 hours. This
                  elasticity of resources, without paying a premium
                  for large scale, is unprecedented in the history of
                  IT.  The economies of scale of very large-scale
                  datacenters combined with ``pay-as-you-go'' resource
                  usage has heralded the rise of Cloud Computing. It
                  is now attractive to deploy an innovative new
                  Internet service on a third party's Internet
                  Datacenter rather than your own infrastructure, and
                  to gracefully scale its resources as it grows or
                  declines in popularity and revenue. Expanding and
                  shrinking daily in response to normal diurnal
                  patterns could lower costs even further. Cloud
                  Computing transfers the risks of over-provisioning
                  or under-provisioning to the Cloud Computing
                  provider, who mitigates that risk by statistical
                  multiplexing over a much larger set of users and who
                  offers relatively low prices due better utilization
                  and from the economy of purchasing at a larger
                  scale. We define terms, present an economic model
                  that quantifies the key buy vs. pay-as-you-go
                  decision, offer a spectrum to classify Cloud
                  Computing providers, and give our view of the top 10
                  obstacles and opportunities to the growth of Cloud
                  Computing.}

title={Fault Tolerance Management in Cloud Computing: A System-Level Perspective}, 
year={2013}, 
volume={7},

pages={288-297}, 
abstract={The increasing popularity of Cloud computing as an
                  attractive alternative to classic information
                  processing systems has increased the importance of
                  its correct and continuous operation even in the
                  presence of faulty components. In this paper, we
                  introduce an innovative, system-level, modular
                  perspective on creating and managing fault tolerance
                  in Clouds. We propose a comprehensive high-level
                  approach to shading the implementation details of
                  the fault tolerance techniques to application
                  developers and users by means of a dedicated service
                  layer. In particular, the service layer allows the
                  user to specify and apply the desired level of fault
                  tolerance, and does not require knowledge about the
                  fault tolerance techniques that are available in the
                  envisioned Cloud and their implementations.},
