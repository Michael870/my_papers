%Traditionally, High Performance Computing (HPC) workloads have been running on dedicated bare-metal clusters. %ranging from tens to thousands of nodes
Recently, cloud computing, both private and public, has attracted more HPC users due to its key benefits, such as ease of management, on-demand resource provisioning, etc. A significant challenge for running HPC in the cloud, however, is to maintain high performance and quality-of-service while simultaneously supporting multiple tenants sharing the same infrastructure. 
In this paper, we present our work in optimizing resource allocation for HPC cloud. %with 
% multi-tenancy and high efficiency. 
% Focusing on HPC throughput workloads, we first apply virtualization to 
% enforce security and fairness for isolation between tenants. Then, 
% we design a scheme to apply CPU and memory over-commitment to improve resource utilization and system throughput. 
% Lastly, we explore dynamic VM migration and other performance tuning techniques to minimize interference and improve QoS. 
Focusing on HPC throughput workloads, we apply a combination of virtualization, resource over-commitment, 
and dynamic migration to enable a multi-tenant and efficiency-optimized approach to HPC cloud. 
By benchmarking popular HPC workloads, we demonstrate that our virtualization based approach could achieve even better performance than bare-metal clusters in certain scenarios.
