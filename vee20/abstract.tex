Traditionally, High Performance Computing (HPC) workloads have been running on dedicated bare-metal clusters ranging from tens to thousands of nodes. Recently, cloud computing has attracted more and more HPC users due to its key benefits, such as ease of management, low total cost of ownership, on-demand resource provisioning, etc. A significant challenge for running HPC in the cloud, however, is to maintain high performance and quality-of-service while simultaneously supporting multiple tenants sharing the same infrastructure. In this work, 
%we design a novel way of configuring Cloud resources with virtual throughput clusters, which integrates with virtualization to support multi-tenancy with both CPU and memory over-commitment. 
we design \textit{virtual throughput clusters}, as a novel approach to allocating cloud resources, with CPU and memory over-commitment to achieve high resource utilization. 
%among multiple HPC tenants. 
Built on top of virtualization, virtual throughput clusters guarantees security and fairness for multi-tenancy support. 
By benchmarking popular HPC workloads, we demonstrate that virtual throughput clusters with CPU over-commitment can achieve better system throughput than bare-metal clusters, and memory over-commitment can be practical in certain scenarios.
