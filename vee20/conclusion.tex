With the rapid growth of AI/ML applications, HPC is increasingly changing our daily life. 
At the same time, in today's digital, data-driven world, cloud computing is transforming
HPC by providing ubiquitous access and virtually unlimited scalability. In this paper, 
we present and validate an innovative design of resource management to enhance resource 
utilization while guaranteeing QoS for HPC cloud. This is pioneering work to apply CPU plus memory 
over-commitment to HPC workloads with comprehensive performance study on its feasibility and limitation. In the future, 
we plan to extend the scope of this work to cover more workloads, such as MPI workloads, and to build 
analytical models to predict the trade-off between performance and over-commitment degree based on 
workload characterization~\cite{arlitt1997internet,234855}.
