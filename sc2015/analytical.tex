Three important metrics for assessing the quality of an application's execution, when Lazy Shadowing is used, are 1) the application failure probability, which measures the level of reliability; 2) expected completion time; and 3) expected energy consumption. In the following we develop mathematical models to analyze the expected performance of Lazy Shadowing, as well as prove the bound on the performance compared to non-failure case, with the understanding
that process replication is a special case of Lazy Shadowing where $\alpha=1$.
